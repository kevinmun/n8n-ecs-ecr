# n8n ECS-ECR Deployment

This project demonstrates how to deploy n8n (workflow automation platform) to AWS using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate, Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry), Amazon EFS for persistent storage, and Amazon CloudFront for global distribution.

## Architecture

The application uses the following AWS services and components:

- **Amazon ECR**: Stores the n8n Docker container image
- **Amazon ECS with Fargate**: Runs the n8n containerized application without managing servers
- **Amazon EFS**: Provides persistent storage for n8n workflows and data (SQLite database)
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic to the ECS tasks on port 5678
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Provides global content delivery and HTTPS termination
- **Amazon S3**: Stores CloudFront access logs
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors and alerts on application metrics
- **Amazon SNS**: Sends notifications for alarms
- **VPC with public subnets**: Provides the networking infrastructure
- **IAM Roles**: Grants necessary permissions for ECS task execution and EFS access

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform installed
- Docker installed
- Existing ECR repository

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 2. Format Terraform Code

```bash
terraform fmt
```

### 3. Prepare Container Image

**If you don't have an image in ECR yet:**
If you haven‚Äôt pushed your app image to ECR yet, Check for ecr_push.sh in scripts folder and run the commands.
This script will:
- Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the docker directory
- Tag the image with the ECR repository URL
- Push the image to the ECR repository

**If you already have an image in ECR:**
You can skip this step and proceed to the next one.

### ‚úÖ Final Checks Before You Deploy
### üîç 1. Double-check Terraform Variable Configuration
Ensure the following are correctly defined and populated:

**In variables.tf:**

- Region
- ECR repo name
- S3 log bucket name (optional default or dynamic name)
- CloudFront price class or alias config (if any)
- email for SNS Topic Subscription
- Restrict access to specific IP addresses for security (Check in VPC module main.tf)
- ECS Tasks memory,CPU and number of tasks
- log retention period

### 4. Plan Terraform Deployment

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

### 5. Apply Terraform Configuration

```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

Or simply:

```bash
terraform apply 
```

### 6. Access the Application

After deployment is complete, you can access the application using the CloudFront domain name, which is available in the Terraform outputs:

```bash
terraform output 
```
You can also access the application directly via the ALB:

```bash
terraform output load_balancer_dns
```
or you can already have a outputs.txt file in local (Thanks to null_resources block in the main.tf)

## Monitoring and Logging

The infrastructure includes CloudWatch monitoring and logging for the CloudFront distribution:

- **CloudWatch Log Group**: Captures CloudFront logs with a 30-day retention period
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Monitors for 403 and 5xx error rates, triggering when they exceed thresholds
- **CloudWatch Dashboard**: Provides visualization of CloudFront metrics including requests and error rates
- **S3 Bucket**: Stores CloudFront access logs with lifecycle policies
- **SNS Topic**: Sends notifications when alarms are triggered

To access the CloudWatch Dashboard:
```bash
aws cloudwatch get-dashboard --dashboard-name $(terraform output -raw cloudwatch_dashboard)
```

## Cleaning Up

To avoid incurring charges, destroy the resources when you're done:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Note about ECR Repository:** The ECR repository is referenced as a data source and not managed by Terraform. If you need to delete the repository and all its images, you'll need to:

1. Uncomment and modify the `aws_ecr_repository` resource in the ECR module
2. Set `force_delete = true` in the resource configuration
3. Update the data source to reference this resource instead
4. Run `terraform apply` followed by `terraform destroy`

**WARNING:** Using `force_delete = true` will delete all images in the repository when destroyed.

## Security Considerations

- The application is deployed in public subnets with a public load balancer for demonstration purposes
- CloudFront provides HTTPS using its default certificate
- CloudWatch alarms monitor for suspicious error patterns
- In a production environment, consider using private subnets for the ECS tasks and implementing additional security measures
- The security group allows inbound traffic on ports 80 and 443

## Customization

- Modify the `docker/index.html` file to change the web content
- Update the module configurations in `main.tf` to adjust the infrastructure
- Edit the task definition in the ECS module to change container specifications
- Adjust CloudWatch alarm thresholds in the CW module
- Add additional email addresses to the SNS notifications

## Terraform Null Resources

This project uses Terraform null resources for several important tasks:

### Output Collection
A null resource in the main configuration collects all important infrastructure outputs into a single text file:
```terraform
resource "null_resource" "outputs" {
  triggers = {
    always_run = "${timestamp()}"
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<-EOT
      echo "VPC ID: ${module.vpc.vpc_id}" > outputs.txt
      echo "ECR Repository URL: ${module.ecr.repository_url}" >> outputs.txt
      # Additional outputs...
    EOT
  }
}
```

## Module Structure

### VPC Module
Creates the networking infrastructure including VPC, subnets, route tables, and security groups.

### ECR Module
References an existing ECR repository.

### ALB Module
Creates the Application Load Balancer, target group, and HTTP listener.

### CloudFront Module
Creates a CloudFront distribution with the ALB as its origin, providing global content delivery and HTTPS.

### S3 Module
Creates an S3 bucket for storing CloudFront access logs with lifecycle policies.

### SNS Module
Creates an SNS topic for alarm notifications with email subscriptions.

### CloudWatch Module
Creates CloudWatch alarms, log groups, and dashboards for monitoring CloudFront metrics.

### ECS Module
Creates the ECS cluster, task definition, and service that runs the containerized application.
