# ECS-ECR Demo Application

This project demonstrates how to deploy a containerized web application to AWS using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate, Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry), and Amazon CloudFront.

## Architecture

The application uses the following AWS services and components:

- **Amazon ECR**: Stores the Docker container image
- **Amazon ECS with Fargate**: Runs the containerized application without managing servers
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic to the ECS tasks
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Provides global content delivery and HTTPS termination
- **Amazon S3**: Stores CloudFront access logs
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors and alerts on application metrics
- **Amazon SNS**: Sends notifications for alarms
- **VPC with public subnets**: Provides the networking infrastructure
- **IAM Roles**: Grants necessary permissions for ECS task execution

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform installed
- Docker installed
- Existing ECR repository

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 2. Format Terraform Code

```bash
terraform fmt
```

### 3. Prepare Container Image

**If you don't have an image in ECR yet:**
If you haven’t pushed your app image to ECR yet, Check for ecr_push.sh in scripts folder and run the commands.
This script will:
- Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the docker directory
- Tag the image with the ECR repository URL
- Push the image to the ECR repository

**If you already have an image in ECR:**
You can skip this step and proceed to the next one.

### ✅ Final Checks Before You Deploy
### 🔍 1. Double-check Terraform Variable Configuration
Ensure the following are correctly defined and populated:

**In variables.tf:**

- Region
- ECR repo name
- S3 log bucket name (optional default or dynamic name)
- CloudFront price class or alias config (if any)
- email for SNS Topic Subscription
- Restrict access to specific IP addresses for security (Check in VPC module main.tf)
- ECS Tasks memory,CPU and number of tasks
- log retention period

### 4. Plan Terraform Deployment

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

### 5. Apply Terraform Configuration

```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

Or simply:

```bash
terraform apply 
```

### 6. Access the Application

After deployment is complete, you can access the application using the CloudFront domain name, which is available in the Terraform outputs:

```bash
terraform output 
```
You can also access the application directly via the ALB:

```bash
terraform output load_balancer_dns
```
or you can already have a outputs.txt file in local (Thanks to null_resources block in the main.tf)

## Monitoring and Logging

The infrastructure includes CloudWatch monitoring and logging for the CloudFront distribution:

- **CloudWatch Log Group**: Captures CloudFront logs with a 30-day retention period
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Monitors for 403 and 5xx error rates, triggering when they exceed thresholds
- **CloudWatch Dashboard**: Provides visualization of CloudFront metrics including requests and error rates
- **S3 Bucket**: Stores CloudFront access logs with lifecycle policies
- **SNS Topic**: Sends notifications when alarms are triggered

To access the CloudWatch Dashboard:
```bash
aws cloudwatch get-dashboard --dashboard-name $(terraform output -raw cloudwatch_dashboard)
```

## Cleaning Up

To avoid incurring charges, destroy the resources when you're done:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Note about ECR Repository:** The ECR repository is referenced as a data source and not managed by Terraform. If you need to delete the repository and all its images, you'll need to:

1. Uncomment and modify the `aws_ecr_repository` resource in the ECR module
2. Set `force_delete = true` in the resource configuration
3. Update the data source to reference this resource instead
4. Run `terraform apply` followed by `terraform destroy`

**WARNING:** Using `force_delete = true` will delete all images in the repository when destroyed.

## Security Considerations

- The application is deployed in public subnets with a public load balancer for demonstration purposes
- CloudFront provides HTTPS using its default certificate
- CloudWatch alarms monitor for suspicious error patterns
- In a production environment, consider using private subnets for the ECS tasks and implementing additional security measures
- The security group allows inbound traffic on ports 80 and 443

## Customization

- Modify the `docker/index.html` file to change the web content
- Update the module configurations in `main.tf` to adjust the infrastructure
- Edit the task definition in the ECS module to change container specifications
- Adjust CloudWatch alarm thresholds in the CW module
- Add additional email addresses to the SNS notifications

## Terraform Null Resources

This project uses Terraform null resources for several important tasks:

### Output Collection
A null resource in the main configuration collects all important infrastructure outputs into a single text file:
```terraform
resource "null_resource" "outputs" {
  triggers = {
    always_run = "${timestamp()}"
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<-EOT
      echo "VPC ID: ${module.vpc.vpc_id}" > outputs.txt
      echo "ECR Repository URL: ${module.ecr.repository_url}" >> outputs.txt
      # Additional outputs...
    EOT
  }
}
```

## Module Structure

### VPC Module
Creates the networking infrastructure including VPC, subnets, route tables, and security groups.

### ECR Module
References an existing ECR repository.

### ALB Module
Creates the Application Load Balancer, target group, and HTTP listener.

### CloudFront Module
Creates a CloudFront distribution with the ALB as its origin, providing global content delivery and HTTPS.

### S3 Module
Creates an S3 bucket for storing CloudFront access logs with lifecycle policies.

### SNS Module
Creates an SNS topic for alarm notifications with email subscriptions.

### CloudWatch Module
Creates CloudWatch alarms, log groups, and dashboards for monitoring CloudFront metrics.

### ECS Module
Creates the ECS cluster, task definition, and service that runs the containerized application.
